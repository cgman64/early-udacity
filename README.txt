These are projects that I completed early on in my Udacity course enrollment.

1. BikeShareAnalysis.ipynb
An optional udacity project prepared me well for investigating baseball data.
Also learned about datetime extraction.
2. StroopEffectProject.pdf
The first Udacity project on statistical inference. 
R was used for visualizations.
